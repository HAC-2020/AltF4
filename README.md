# Seguro Medico
A platform that provides immutable medical records and financial assistance facility for patients(crowdfunding)

## Inspiration-

With the advancement of technology and medical science, not every patient can afford the costly medical facilities. According to a CarePayment Research Survey, it was quite clearly found that almost 64% of all the patients in America either avoids or delays any medical care because of the high cost.

And these statistics are even worse for many other underdeveloped countries like India. Low on cost, high on quality of care, and with a wide range of treatments available — the Indian healthcare system draws over 1.3 million patients from abroad each year. The sector is expected to generate $3 billion by the end of 2013. In Harvard Business Review’s November issue, a study by authors Vijay Govindarajan and Ravi Ramamurti gave private hospitals in India a thumbs-up for “delivering world-class health care, affordably”. Yet, 99% of India’s population cannot afford these services, shows World Bank data. Each year, 39 million people are pushed into poverty by out-of-pocket payments for healthcare, with households on average devoting 5.8% of their expenditures to medical care, the data reveals.

## Pain points-

A 33-year-old software engineer working in the private sector lost her savings of eight years in a day when her father, 65, underwent a liver transplant in a private hospital. “Not only did my savings go, but I also had to borrow money from the family to foot the bill. The procedure and hospitalization cost almost Rs 30 lakh, and she had to continue spending Rs 10,000 each month for medicines, follow-up consultations, and diagnostics,” [Hindustan times Report](https://www.hindustantimes.com/health-and-fitness/healthcare-in-india-cheap-but-not-for-most-indians/story-0bEJutPTC3krc5GpKBjV4J.html).Each round of chemotherapy and radiation costs her almost Rs 1 lakh, but she didn’t consider AIIMS because the radiotherapy machine there is booked for the next seven months.

## Rise in the current problem during this pandemic
- Financial distress has been one of the biggest impacts of the COVID 19-induced lockdown.

- According to India Today.”Consumables like PPE kits, masks, face shields, and gloves which used to take up around 10% of the hospital bill, have now increased to 50% and this   has left many struggling to pay hospital bills.”

- Private hospitals in India are overcharging for safety gear in the absence of government regulation -
  Saima Furqan’s 60-year-old uncle was admitted to Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in Delhi with Covid-19 in April. After 30 days in the private hospital, the family was given a 122-page   bill and charged Rs 16,14,596. What struck Furqan in the bill is that the family was charged a flat rate of Rs 10,000 per day for the personal protective equipment, commonly     known as PPE, worn by medical staff treating her uncle. The family paid Rs 2.9 lakh for PPE alone, which is 18% of their total bill.
 
- Private players
- Differences across hospitals
- Discrepancies in pricing
- Price regulation

This all has become a major issue dropping Indian citizens into financial conditions like taking loans and so many to go below the poverty line.

## What it does

Seguro Medico provides immutable management and access of medical records and financial assistance to patients.

- If observed carefully, it can quite clearly be seen that the major hurdle that prevents the patients to be in control of the complete insurance or donation amount is the long   list of third parties as well as the central authorities in control. And that is exactly the two major issues that Seguro Medico effectively solves.

- First of all, this is a decentralized application and therefore eradicates any control of central authorities over the medical funds or donation amounts. This ensures the       utmost security from any tamper with medical data that might take place in traditional systems.

- Secondly, Medicare Chain implements a smart contract. This contract not only operates independently but also keeps an immutable record of the participants withdrawing or         donating funds while maintaining a control system that limits the accessibility of participants in the network from certain features. Thus, smart contracts in Seguro Medico     ensures reliability and trust in the system since there is no chance of any mishaps with medical funds due to Human bias. 

-  Finally, each and every transaction that takes place on this application, along with its timestamp, is stored with utmost safety on the Blockchain. Thus ensuring complete        immutability of the data.
