A platform that provides immutable medical records and financial assistance facility for patients(crowdfunding)

##Inspiration-

With the advancement of technology and medical science, not every patient can afford the costly medical facilities. According to a CarePayment Research Survey, it was quite clearly found that almost 64% of all the patients in America either avoids or delays any medical care because of the high cost.

And these statistics are even worse for many other underdeveloped countries like India. Low on cost, high on quality of care, and with a wide range of treatments available — the Indian healthcare system draws over 1.3 million patients from abroad each year. The sector is expected to generate $3 billion by the end of 2013. In Harvard Business Review’s November issue, a study by authors Vijay Govindarajan and Ravi Ramamurti gave private hospitals in India a thumbs-up for “delivering world-class health care, affordably”. Yet, 99% of India’s population cannot afford these services, shows World Bank data. Each year, 39 million people are pushed into poverty by out-of-pocket payments for healthcare, with households on average devoting 5.8% of their expenditures to medical care, the data reveals.

A 33-year-old software engineer working in the private sector lost her savings of eight years in a day when her father, 65, underwent a liver transplant in a private hospital. “Not only did my savings go, but I also had to borrow money from the family to foot the bill. The procedure and hospitalization cost almost Rs 30 lakh, and she had to continue spending Rs 10,000 each month for medicines, follow-up consultations, and diagnostics,” [Hindustan times Report](https://www.hindustantimes.com/health-and-fitness/healthcare-in-india-cheap-but-not-for-most-indians/story-0bEJutPTC3krc5GpKBjV4J.html).Each round of chemotherapy and radiation costs her almost Rs 1 lakh, but she didn’t consider AIIMS because the radiotherapy machine there is booked for the next seven months.
